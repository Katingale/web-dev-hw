    <h1> T.S. Eliot Bio</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I graduated from what-counts-as-prestigious-on-the-west-coast college and spent the months of slow realization that a degree does not guarantee even a response from the several hundred employers I applied to sitting at the side of the YMCA pool being a lifeguard.  Memorizing Prufrock's lovesong was an effort to convince myself those were not wasted hours but a valuable opportunity to better my mind. </p>
    <p>Anyway, Thomas Stearns Eliot was a poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, literary critic and editor. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, he moved to England in 1914 at the age of 25 and went on to settle, work and marry there. He wrote all sorts of cool stuff, ultimately leading to the work that would inspire the most notorious cinematic flop of the last decade.</p>
    <p> I hope he's proud of himself.</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot">(Source)</a>
