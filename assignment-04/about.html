    <h1> T.S. Eliot Bio</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I graduated from what-counts-as-prestigious-on-the-west-coast college and spent the months of slow realization that a degree does not guarantee so much as a response from the several hundred employers I applied to by sitting at the side of the YMCA pool working as a lifeguard.  Memorizing the Lovesong of Prufrock was my effort to convince myself those were not wasted hours but a valuable opportunity to better my mind. </p>
    <p>Anyway, Thomas Stearns Eliot was a poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, literary critic and editor. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, he moved to England in 1914 at the age of 25 and went on to settle, work and marry there.</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot">(Source)</a>
