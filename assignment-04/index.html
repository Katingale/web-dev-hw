    <h1>The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>

    <pre>           Let us go then, you and I,
        When the evening is spread out against the sky
        Like a patient etherized upon a table;
        Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
        The muttering retreats
        Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
        And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
        Streets that follow like a tedious argument
        Of insidious intent
        To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
        Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
        Let us go and make our visit.
        
                       In the room the women come and go
                       Talking of Michelangelo.
        
           The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
        The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
        Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
        Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
        Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
        Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
        And seeing that it was a soft October night,
        Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.
