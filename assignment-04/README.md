 MTV was the obvious one.  Ten years ago there was a charming list of all the "retired" music videos they'd taken off their top charts, and it was lots of Brittney.  That woman is a icon.  
Beyond that just improved graphics, more interactivity, less classy line up, arguably.

Starting was hard, this class began before I even had my grades from my previous semester and I was burnt out!  Catching up asap tho.  Took me a long time to figure out the pushing of files through Github desktop, but only because missed the tutorial videos for some reason.  After much stress and worry I finally feel like I get it.  Hopefully. 

Probably not spending enough time on responses in my desperation to get back to catching up on the content, so I'm hoping for feedback soon if I need to spend more thought and effort on this part.
