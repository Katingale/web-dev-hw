*How many main document ```<head> and <body> ``` elements can a page have?*

    Like, Elements within the Head and Body? I presume it's close to infinite?

*How are these elements different, or what role do they play?*

    The Head is not a visible component on the page itself, although components can be visible, e.g. the Title. This is for Metadata, or the "thoughts" of the page, as you call it, communicated mostly for the browser and processor.  The Body includes the data and formatting information that will be produced onto the webpage.

*Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.*

Structural info is the architecture of the page, it improves readability with elements like headers, breaks, and list formatting.
Semantic mark up alters the characters in the text, creating bold text, superscript, etc.

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*

Blew through this one in about two hours, easy peasy...although I'm saving the Duckett pages to read at my office desk tomorrow.  
I did have a hiccup typing in the mailto tag, not sure what went wrong but when I finally copypasta'd a seemingly identical line it *did* function...will revisit.
