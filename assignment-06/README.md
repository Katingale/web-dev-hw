*Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?*
Oh loads, atm most come from the U--email links to Survey Monkey or something similar to collect anonymous data on student's use of campus resouces.  
Like mnay other surveys, they're designed to measure interest and awareness--and what gets measured gets managed.


*List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.*
Text entries include the common name/password combinations, providing security to a user's access to a site.
Selections like the drop down list enables a predetermined list of options, so the user must select a response within the available data series, like nationality.
Buttons like an "Enter site" button can be jazzed up with an image, making it a unique, attention-grabbing element of site interactivity.

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*
The module inspired a rambling monologue from my webdev partner about how forms and tables are never used anymore, javascript blahblahblah.
But I remember using them a bit in highschool code class and the material was presented in small manageable chunks. I built my index page as I worked through the module and hopefully everything went okay.
