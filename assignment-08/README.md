*Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?*

Gratefully, I'd been exposed to the concept of markup language by an amazing highschool prof back in 2005. Even though I left with the certainty that coding would never be my bag, the awareness has stayed with me over the years as the web becomes increasingly part of our lives...I even got into the habit of viewing sourcecode every so often out of sheer curiosity.  It's all been interesting, mostly in overcoming my aversion--I've enjoyed the material a lot so far!  Like I was telling my partner earlier tonight: 

'''Yaknow, the really beautiful part of coding is the immediate sandbox aspect. I could read about chemistry all week long and then go to a lab and be too scared mistakes and getting an F to do anything but follow the directions exactly like a recipe.  And physics, good luck trying out too many theories in your bedroom without a particle collider. 

But here I can copypasta all sorts of html and immediately play with it, make mistakes, figure them out--so hands on! Magical.


*Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?*
Hahaha, how to make sites that get me out of this strong 90's nostalgia.  I really love beautifying, I'm happy to sit and fiddle with a border width or a shade of puce for an hour...this might be a terrible thing, we'll see.


*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment:*
The bare bones of the assignment was easy, it was amazing to see how far I'd come (in just a week since I started awfully late).
