*Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?*

Gratefully, I'd been exposed to the concept of markup languages by an amazing highschool prof back in 2005. Even though I left with the certainty that coding would never be my bag, the awareness has stayed with me over the years as the web becomes increasingly part of our lives...I even got into the habit of viewing a page's source code every so often, just for fun.  The material's been engaging and I'm slowly losing my aversion--I'd go so far as to say I'm enjoying this, a bit. 

*Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?*
Hahaha, how to make sites that get me out of this strong 90's nostalgia.  I'm excited to start beautifying--I'm happy to sit and fiddle with a border width or a shade of puce for an hour...actually this might be a terrible thing.

The bare bones of the assignment was easy, it was amazing to see how far I'd come (in just a week since I started awfully late).
