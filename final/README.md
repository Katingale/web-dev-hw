*Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?*

I'm not sure I learned anything strictly about Github persay, but I learned so much, in crash course style getting this site put together. I took a lot of direction from my partner on how to stretch and learn some new code.  Decided that to make the gallery effect I wanted, to just create a new style sheet and use the hover display:none attributes to rotate the pictures through the portal center frame.  Then learned about the target pseudo-class to make them appear fullscreen as a block element when clicked.  I'm worried about retaining all this after a late night but thank goodness MDN and W3 school will always be there to review.

*Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?*

Found out that some Youtube videos disable iframe placement, but inserted some alternatives.  Definitley played around a lot with fonts and backgrounds and opacities.  

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*

I started this late, and I was so grateful that I was given an extension through Sunday night.  My favorite part was designing a vector graphic for the portal frame, pulling in old bits of art for a banner and doodles to populate the gallery.  It's a thrill to see art up on a real website.  I'm sad I didn't have time to fill in the copy with real bio and home page text but I'm glad I focused on stretching myself on the code side.  Built the five basic pages, pulling in a lot of stuff from older assignments, and then worked a lot trying to figure out the gallery part.  Really proud of getting it done just by deadline.
