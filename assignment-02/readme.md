# Assignment 2
## Kat Fischer

I took a coding class in high school and **haaated** it.  
Everyone seemed to pick it up faster and produce more complex projects...and by the end I had a deserved B which tanked my prized 4.0 gpa. That was fifteen years ago and I've had an absolute dread and despair attached to coding ever since.  Nevertheless, I can read the writing on the screen as society shifts itself from brick and mortar into the intangible realm of the digital. 
Also, my advisor implied I needed this class to graduate. :wink:

- Not to be afraid of code
- Maybe how to design my own site to host art on
- How to make a list in MarkDown (yay!)
