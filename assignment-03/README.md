*Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.*

Very briefly, a browser is a program that processes code to create a UI for us mortals to access the internet.  
A rendering engine processes the visual representation of a webpage, the browser engine directs action between the UI, the rendering engine, and servers, and a Javascript interpretor provides interactive functionality to the page by translating the Javascript components. 
I use Chrome and Safari because it's there...and I haven't experienced any significant differences given my very basic needs for the software.

*What is a markup language? Describe one commonly used in development.*

There are three types of language used for browsers and markup languages are used primarily for text. Like HTML.
