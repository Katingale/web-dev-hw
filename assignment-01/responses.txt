How is the web different than the internet?

The internet is the system of interconnected networks that share a single file
transfer protocal that allows for global communications linked by a variety of electonic, wireless, and optical technologies.  
The Web is accessed via the internet and is an information resource based on the interface created by HTTP and web browsers.  

Briefly describe how the internet works.
Individual networks are connected by Internet Service Providers.  An individual client has a unique IP address and all outgoing data packets are labeled with this 'home' 
address.  
As the packets are transferred through the network, they are directed by routers and each IP number become a step in the path to preventing data from getting lost.

What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
Directories conceptually serve the same purpose as a folder--they nest a collection of related files.  
A path shows a program a way into a directory to the file it's intended to use.  

Why is using a VCS beneficial?
It's a control mechanism--as you develop your code it allows you to go back to a previous state.
