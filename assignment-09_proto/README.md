*Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?*
They really represent descending levels of specificity, an important factor for cascading:
Universal is the ohm of the page, it selects all elements;
element will select *all* elemnt of the type you define;
class is a name you give to *any* element and multiple elements can share a class;
id is *only* used of one element on a page and directs changes to that specific element.

*Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.*
