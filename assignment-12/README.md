*Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?*

Client provides insect colonies for pesticide control. They wanted a simple site with a top nav bar and drop down list of links for people to learn more about organic pest control options and the benefits of insects.  They chose a green and red color theme although I'd like to keep tweaking it to be a little less garish.  

All placeholder images were pulled from Google and labeled reuse, but I haven't listed attributions yet. Client is eager to provide me with their own images soon.


*What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?*
Display: block can turn an inline element into a line-starting block element (used for vertical lists).
Display: inline shifts block elements into inline elements so they can share a horizontal row.
Display: inline-block is similar to inline except that block attributes of margin and vertical space are maintained.   



*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*
I learned a lot on this, spent a lot of time asking my partner questions like "why aren't my links centered in the div, it SHOULD be working!" etc...


We went down a rabbit hole trying to understand why the 10% margin didn't apply to the top of the child box in this Module 11 codepen:

Found some work arounds but still very weird.
