*Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?*

They really represent descending levels of specificity, an important factor for cascading:
Universal (*) selects all elements;
Element will select *all* elements of the type you define;
Class is a name you give to *any* element and multiple elements can share a class;
Id is *only* used for one element on a page and directs changes to that specific element.

*Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.*
 
 I've never seen such a masterful use of color as in this film, and while my palette doesn't do it justice, one of my favorite scenes is going from the muted cool greens, browns, and beiges of academia to the vivid pink and orange sunset scene--and all that expresses about the character's muted, repressed sensuality.

This was the first assignment I really struggled with.  I was fumbling around with tables and padding and absolute positions and finally my partner sent me [this MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/Box_Alignment_in_Flexbox) and tried to teach me about Flexbox. I'm still figuring it out, but it seems so helpful for centering and positioning boxes and I finally got this assignment to work.
