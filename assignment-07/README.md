*Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.*

  Divs set off a section of page that reaches to both sides.

  Classes are like attributes you can apply to elements determined by what you want to include in the style section for each class.

  ids are a unique attribute used to identify an element on the page so they can be styled independently.

  Spans isolate a smaller section of page that needs to be different, like a line of text.



*What is "alt text," and why do we use it?*
"Alt text" is text that describes the content of an image.  Not only is this useful in the event your image fails to load, but it's essential for many sites to comply with ADA standards and be accessible by screen readers for the visually impaired to utilize your site.


*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment:*
Seemed like a long one but I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to embed hosted audio and video.  Very frustrated by one sticky point: the poster image does not seem to stick on the embedded M.Art intro.  Maybe I'll figure it out, not sure where the bug is...
