*Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.*

  Divs set off a section of page that reaches to both sides.

  Classes are like attributes you can apply to elements determined by what you want to include in the style section for each class.

  ids are a unique attribute used to identify an element on the page so they can be styled independently.

  Spans isolate a smaller section of page that needs to be different, like a line of text.



*What is "alt text," and why do we use it?*
"Alt text" is text that describes the content of an image.  Not only is this useful in the event your image fails to load, but it's essential for many sites to comply with ADA standards and be accessible by screen readers for the visually impaired to utilize your site.
